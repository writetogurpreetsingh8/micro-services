how we can done exception handling in ms?
ByDefault every MS (if having eureka-netflix-client jar) looking for MS(eurka-netflix-server) , So how we can make them stop / change its default behaviour?
how to configure Actuator dashboard , hystrix dashboard and another dashboard also
how to setup eureka-netflix-client and eurka-netflix-server on different machines... with having user defined port and urls.......
how to mention application name and servlet.context.path in the config-server becoz when we passing for the same config-client not able to access config-server ??
how to change the config-server port becoz when we changed default port(8888) config-client not able to fetch data from ......
how to control the logs of ms , eureka-netflix-client and eurka-netflix-server , continues dislays how to stop or control ????????
how we can use ms specific , profile/env specific and default file(application.properties) all together ?
how to dockerzie the application and orchestrate it 
tools like zapkin sluth

what is resource expension and protocol conversion in zuul proxy?

Response must be retured with hypermedia control (HATOS) only in case of post operation,  no need to add hataos in the response while deleting , updating and getting the response , right ????

can you explain , actually I am little bit confused b/w them 
difference b/w event driven , message driven and domain driven , are they all related / depended on each-other ??? 

difference b/w choreography and orchestrate ? 

why we need to maintain the saga logs into kafa, wouldn't it save into saga itself only and I think its temporary logs 
so we shouldn't have need to save them , is it right ???

how we can confiure zuul api gateway while calling 1 ms another ms???????????????

why we need to hide the url of ms because at the frot of ms we have api-gate way and we also have LB at the front of api-gate ?????
Q what is dynamic routing in the zuul ?
Q if we  put logging in the zuul level than can't we have logging in the micro-service's level ?
Q what is the role of traceId in slueth logs

I have a doubt regarding proxy-pattern , if end-user going to invoke dns url(enterprise url) then call goes to loadbalancer , 
loadbalacener invoke api-gateway and api-gatway  invokes the micro-services that means no one is going to invoke ms 
direcly from out - side world then why we need of url hiding (Proxy patterns) ,, Pl explain once ....... 

when to use defaultFallback and fallbackmethod ??????? 

suppose if we encounter any checked exception while procesing busniess logic so 
in this case can we implement hystrix to handle it ? or we should handle exception as previously we did ??? 

how we can intercept the request in b/w micro-service to implements some common busniess logic ?????

what would be the url in webhook ????

if we have 10 services and we want to store config on the git-hub, so would be create 10
different repo or just one ????

oauth is only used for thrid-party login or single sign on ???????????????
why referesh toke is not valid in case of servies ???

why we need access token again & again, becoz when user has been valid 
and logged into the system,  client can store the basic
info into its DB which is provide by resource-server, so that when user
again come to client system client can identify him, right ????  ,, 

you store jwt token in-memory , can we use DB for
the same , or what approach would be the best one ??

if user logins into web-app via browsers and 
he again logins into same application via mobile aap this time 
now what will happened ???, there are two tokens 
associataed with the same user , then in this case if user logged out from mobile aap 
will i invalidate a that particul  token only

why you make apigateway and payment service as 
a resource-server , we have seperate resource-server here

Q1) As u created two queues in the mq-server becoz we have two ms but in case we have 1 more ms
then would we need to changed the code of server to add one more queue,,,? or having 
losely coupled approached ??????????????


Q2) instead of config-server tells the services about config changes
we have introduced the bus all the services are listing the bus and config-server tell the changes to bus only
but there is also network calls (from all services to bus , and bus and services would be on different machine)
how this model is better then config-server direct talk to servies to tell them changes regarding config

Q3) while making communications in b/w service by using messaging-queue, do we need eureka-server ????? 
if yes why , if no then why ????

=================================================================================================================

Q4) what is difference oauth2.0 and jwt , when to use what ??????????????

Q5) How can i invalidate a jwtoken forcefully when i call logout or security breach ? .

Q6) if user logged out and we have invalidate the token which is stored
in the DB, but if user tries to invoke any url and passing token 
then how server will come to know that this token has been invalidate previously 

that means we have to make db hit for eevery request, without
db hit how will come to know that , this token has been invalidate??

Q7) when we use blacklist a JWT. ???

Q8) if user token was compromised how we invalid all tokens associataed that user!

Ability to force log out all users.
Ability to force log out any individual at any time.
Ability to require password re-entry after a certain amount of time.
Ability to work with multiple clients.
Ability to force a re-log in when a user clicks logout from a particular client. 

Q9) how to use oauthtemplate with feign ????

Q10) why we have @enableResoureServer annotation in the oauth-server micro-server becoz
oauth-server micro-server is just a Autherization server.........?

Q11) why we have @enableResoureServer in api-gateway,becoz its just api-gateway doesn't have any resource to server. ?

Q12) when api-gateway doesn't need to talk to oauth-server then why we put its entry in api-gateway's properties file,
infact each service has security.oauth2.resource.user-info-uri=http://oauth-server/user what is use of this ?

Q13) why we need to hit authorization-server first to get the token and then invoke another services(vai gateway),
how it would be happened in real time, because end user would have enterprise url only how would he
invoke authorization-server to get the token ?????  

Q14) we are just passing/using the token then how its checked against its scope.. becoz
we are not using entire oauth-token that is given by oauth-server? 

Q15) when creating oauthresttemplate we are accessing oauth-server directly , how can we communicate with
via eureka-server????

how to test the ms if we have put security on that ???? 

does we implemenents asych communications b/w MS ???????
messaging endpoints
twelve factor principle
 Dynamic Routing
Distributed Sessions
Need for Event Driven Systems

21-06-2020
its looks like more tough to develop the code
and test whether its working on cloud or container,
if not then fix them again over again ??


in autoscalling vm instances are getting replicated, 
but what about if i want to increase the number of instances of MS,,   ????? 
it would be increased within the same vm or different one ???? 


how userms and orderms knows that there is another eureka
is also up and running ????

what is throatling , rate limit, can u explain 
how we can implemnet them ??


what is difference b/w docker and kubarnets ,

 I am very much confuesed ?? what is kubarnets used for ??

how to create docker file ???

As you said N replications of MS, we need N different VM machines,
but earlier u said within the same VM we can have multiple 
docker containers.

in last class we were discussing, how userMS can use 
eurkea-server to get the instance of oauth-server , do u rememeber ?
